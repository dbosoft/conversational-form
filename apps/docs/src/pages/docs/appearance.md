When altering the apperance of Conversational Form you have two options:

*   Use one of our pre-built themes
*   Compile (SCSS) to build your own theme
*   Overriding CSS

Pre-built themes
----------------

We have bundled six themes with v1.0.0: light (default), dark, red, green, blue, purple.

The theme can be set using the 'theme' option when instantiating CF - as shown in the StackBlitz-example below.

Compile your own theme

Example - Overriding styles
